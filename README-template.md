## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries for responsiveness
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to:

- Use media queries to make a page responsive.
- Structure a recipe page with semantic HTML.
- Style elements using CSS Flexbox for layout and alignment.
- Implement a clean and visually appealing design.

Here is an example of a media query I used:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .food-container {
    width: 90%;
    padding: 15px;
  }
}
```
